# dazzle-duo-final
Dazzle Duo is a website designed by Hien Nguyen, Sababu Barashango, Nicolas Badila, and Jaidon Christian inorder to provide fitting date ideas based on the user's own personality. We split the personality types into 2 main ones: introverts and extroverts. 

The features of our site includes: appealing graphic design, a fully functioning personality test for those who do not know their own personality type, a navbar, a login form to save your date, and a button that provides the user with date ideas. 

Some technologies that were used include: 
Bootstrap: for css styling with the nav bar and 
Netlify: used to make the site publicly avaliable on a web domain.
